// getElementsByClassName

/*
The getElementsByClassName() method is a part of the JavaScript document object and it allows developers to access multiple elements on a web page by their class name. This method returns a live HTMLCollection of elements with the given class name, or an empty HTMLCollection if no such elements are found.

For example, consider the following HTML code:
*/
// THis is a html
{
  /**
<div class="myClass">This is my div</div>
<div class="myClass">This is my div</div>
<div class="myClass">This is my div</div>

 */
}

/*
The following JavaScript code can be used to access the elements with the class name "myClass" and change their text:
*/
let elements = document.getElementsByClassName("myClass");
for (let i = 0; i < elements.length; i++) {
  elements[i].innerHTML = "This is my new text";
}

/*
The getElementsByClassName() method is a convenient way to access multiple elements on a web page, as it allows developers to select elements based on their class name rather than their unique ID. This method is especially useful when working with large and complex web pages, as it allows developers to quickly and easily access multiple elements that share the same class name.

It's important to note that the getElementsByClassName() method returns a live HTMLCollection, which means that the collection is updated automatically as elements are added or removed from the web page. Also, this method is case-sensitive, meaning that "myClass" and "myclass" are considered to be different class names.

In conclusion, the getElementsByClassName() method is a powerful tool for accessing multiple elements on a web page by their class name. Understanding how to use this method is essential for creating dynamic and interactive web pages, as it allows developers to quickly and easily access multiple elements that share the same class name. However, it's important to keep in mind that the method returns a live HTMLCollection and is case-sensitive.
