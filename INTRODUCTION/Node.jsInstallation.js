Node.js Installation
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It is commonly used for building server-side applications, command-line tools, and other types of scalable network programs.

To install Node.js, you can follow these steps:

1. Download the installer: Go to the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org/) and click the "Download" button to download the latest version of the Node.js installer.

2. Run the installer: Double-click the downloaded installer file to start the installation process. Follow the prompts to complete the installation.

3. Verify the installation: To verify that Node.js has been installed successfully, open a terminal or command prompt and type the following command:

Run the following command:

"node -v"


This should output the version number of Node.js that you have installed.

That's it! You should now have Node.js installed on your system and be able to run JavaScript code using the "node" command.

I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any questions.

Script using Node.js
To run JavaScript with Visual Studio Code (VS Code), you will need to follow these steps:

1. Install VS Code: If you don't already have it, you can download and install VS Code from the official website (https://code.visualstudio.com/).

2. Create a new JavaScript file: Open VS Code and create a new file with a .js extension. You can do this by going to File > New File or by using the shortcut Ctrl + N.

3. Write your JavaScript code: Type your JavaScript code into the file and save it.

4. Open the Command Palette: You can open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl + Shift + P or by going to View > Command Palette.

5. Run the JavaScript file: In the Command Palette, type "Run JavaScript" and select "Run JavaScript file in the terminal" from the list of options. This will open a terminal window and run your JavaScript file.

6. View the output: The output of your JavaScript code will be displayed in the terminal window.

    Alternatively, you can also run JavaScript code directly in the terminal by using a command-line interpreter such as Node.js. To do this, you will need to install Node.js and then run your JavaScript file using the "node" command, followed by the name of the file. For example:

 

node myfile.js
