// What are Variables?

/* 
In JavaScript, variables are used to store data. They are an essential part of any programming language, as they allow you to store, retrieve, and manipulate data in your programs.

There are a few different ways to declare variables in JavaScript, each with its own syntax and rules. In this blog post, we'll take a look at the different types of variables available in JavaScript and how to use them.

// Declaring Variables

// To declare a variable in JavaScript, you use the "var" keyword followed by the name of the variable. For example:

var x;

// This declares a variable called "x" but does not assign any value to it. You can also assign a value to a variable when you declare it, like this:

var x = 10;

// In JavaScript, you can also use the "let" and "const" keywords to declare variables. The "let" keyword is used to declare a variable that can be reassigned later, while the "const" keyword is used to declare a variable that cannot be reassigned. For example:

let y = 20;
const z = 30;

// In this example, "y" is a variable that can be reassigned, while "z" is a constant that cannot be reassigned.

// Data Types

/*

    In JavaScript, there are several data types that you can use to store different types of data. Some common data types include:

- Numbers (e.g. 10, 3.14)
- Strings (e.g. "hello", 'world')
- Booleans (e.g. true, false)
- Arrays (e.g. [1, 2, 3])
- Objects (e.g. { name: "John", age: 30 })
